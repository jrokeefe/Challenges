        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);

        /* you must create a program that creates a custom half arrow based on what the user inputs.
            For example, an entry of arrowBaseHeight = 3, arrowBaseWidth = 4, arrowHeadWidth would
            output:

            ****
            ****
            ****
            *****
            ****
            ***
            **
            *

            MIND:
            1. The program must only accept positive integers. The program must continue to ask for 
            user inputs until an appropriate input is made.
            2. The arrowHeadWidth must be greater than arrowBaseWidth. FOR EXAMPLE, if a user were to
            input a arrowBaseWidth of 7, the program would only accept a minimum int of 8 for the
            arrowHeadWidth. If the user inputs 7 or less, the program must ask again.

            EXAMPLES:
            Program: Enter arrow base height:
            User: -4
            Program: Enter arrow base height:
            User: 4
            Program: Enter arrow base width:
            User: 3
            Program: Enter arrow head width:
            User: -5
            Program: Enter arrow head width:
            User: 3
            Program: Enter arrow head width:
            User: 6
            Program: ***
                     ***
                     ***
                     ***
                     ******
                     *****
                     ****
                     ***
                     **
                     *
